# QuantumControlBase

The [QuantumControlBase](https://github.com/JuliaQuantumControl/QuantumControlBase.jl) package was originally intended to provide methods the are useful to multiple packages within the [JuliaQuantumControl](https://github.com/juliaquantumcontrol) organization. As of `QuantumControl` version 0.11, it is obsolete, with all of its functionality directly included in the [QuantumControl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantumControl/QuantumControl.jl) package.

Packages like [GRAPE](https://github.com/JuliaQuantumControl/GRAPE.jl) and [Krotov](https://github.com/JuliaQuantumControl/Krotov.jl) now directly extend [QuantumControl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantumControl/QuantumControl.jl).
