The value for the first and last \"midpoint\" will remain the original values at the beginning and end of tlist, in order to ensure exact boundary conditions. For all other midpoints, the value for that midpoint will be calculated by \"un-averaging\".\n\nFor example, for a control and tlist of length 5, consider the following diagram:\n\ntlist index:       1   2   3   4   5\ntlist:             ⋅   ⋅   ⋅   ⋅   ⋅   input values cᵢ (i ∈ 1..5)\n                   |̂/ ̄ ̄ ̂\\ / ̂\\ / ̂ ̄ ̄\\|̂\nmidpoints:         x     x   x     x   output values pᵢ (i ∈ 1..4)\nmidpoints index:   1     2   3     4\n\nWe will have p₁=c₁ for the first value, p₄=c₅ for the last value. For all other points, the control values cᵢ = fracp_i-1 + p_i2 are the average of the values on the midpoints. This implies the \"un-averaging\" for the midpoint values pᵢ = 2 c_i - p_i-1.\n\nnote: Note\nAn arbitrary input control array may not be compatible with the above averaging formula. In this case, the conversion will be \"lossy\" (discretize will not recover the original control array; the difference should be considered a \"discretization error\"). However, any further round-trip conversions between points and intervals are bijective and preserve the boundary conditions. In this case, the discretize_on_midpoints and discretize methods are each other's inverse. This also implies that for an optimal control procedure, it is safe to modify midpoint values.
