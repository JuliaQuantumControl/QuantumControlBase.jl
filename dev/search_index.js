The propagation is performed by calling propstep! for every interval in tlist, or propstep if in_place=false.\n\nFor the i'th time interval, genfunc(tlist, i) must return the generator for that time interval. Generally, when approximating a time-continuous dynamical generator as piecewise-constant on the time grid, it should be evaluated at the midpoint of the interval. A possible exception is the first and last interval, which may be better evaluated at tlist[1] and tlist[end] to ensure exact boundary conditions like control fields that are exactly zero.\n\nIn addition to the two positional parameters indicating the time interval, genfunc will also receive the state (the input state for the propagation step), backwards, storage, observables, control_parameters, and init as keyword arguments.\n\nThe control_parameters are an optional array of floats with parameters for genfunc. This is required when propagate is used in the context of automatic differentiation (AD). E.g., the Zygote framework can automatically calculate gradients of a function control_parameters -> J_T, where J_T might be be a function of the overlap between a propagated state (returned by propagate) and a target state. Thus, the control_parameters must be explicit in propagate.  Outside of an AD context, control_parameters are not generally required: they can be implicit in genfunc.\n\nThe remaining keyword arguments may be used for unusual equations of motion beyond the standard Schrödinger or Liouville-von-Neumann equation, e.g. state would enter the genfunc for a Gross–Pitaevskii equation. For standard equations of motion that do not use the additional parameters, it is best to capture the keyword arguments to genfunc with a definition like\n\ngenfunc(tlist, i; kwargs...) = ...\n\nFor valid propagation methods, see initpropwrk.\n\nIn general, there is no requirement that tlist has a constant time step, although some propagation methods (most notably cheby!) only support a uniform time grid.\n\nIf storage is given as an Array, it will be filled with data determined by the observables. The default \"observable\" results in the propagated states at every point in time being stored. The storage array should be created with init_storage. See its documentation for details.\n\nThe storage parameter may also be given as true, and a new storage array will be created internally with init_storage and returned instead of the propagated state:\n\ndata = propagate(\n    state, genfunc, tlist; method=:auto\n    backwards=false; storage=true, observables=observables,\n    hook=nothing, showprogress=false, kwargs...)\n\nIf backwards is true, the input state is assumed to be at time tlist[end], and the propagation progresses backwards in time (with a negative time step dt). If storage is given, it will be filled back-to-front during the backwards propagation.\n\nIf hook is given as a callable, it will be called after each propagation step, as hook(state, generator, tlist, i, wrk, observables) where i is the index of the time interval on tlist covered by the propagation step (0 for the initial state, respectives lastindex(tlist) for the backward propagation).  The hook is called before calculating any observables. Example usage includes writing data to file, or modifying state, e.g., removing amplitude from the lowest and highest level to mitigate \"truncation error\".\n\nIf showprogress is given as true, a progress bar will be shown for long-running propagationn. In order to customize the progress bar, showprogress may also be a function that receives length(tlist) and returns a ProgressMeter.Progress instance.\n\nIf in_place=false is given, the propagation avoids in-place operations by using propstep instead of propstep!. This is often required in the context of automatic differentiation (AD), e.g., with Zygote. That is, use in_place=false if propagate is called inside a function to be passed to Zygote.gradient, Zygote.pullback, or a similar function. In and AD context, storage and showprogress should not be used.\n\nThe propagate routine returns the propagated state at tlist[end], respectively tlist[1] if backwards=true, or a storage array with the stored states / observable data if storage=true.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"quantumpropagators/#QuantumPropagators.propstep!-Tuple{Any, Any, Any, QuantumPropagators.Cheby.ChebyWrk}","page":"QuantumPropagators","title":"QuantumPropagators.propstep!","text":"Perform a single propagation step in-place.\n\npropstep!(state, generator, dt, wrk; kwargs...)\n\nThe propagation method is determined by wrk, see initpropwrk.\n\nGenerally, an in-place propagation will not be suitable for in the context of automatic differentiation.

This discretization is more stable than directly evaluationg the control function at the values of tlist, and ensures that repeated round-trips between discretize and discretize_on_midpoints can be done safely, see the note in the documentation of discretize_on_midpoints.\n\nThe latter can still be achieved by passing via_midpoints=false. While such a direct discretization is suitable e.g. for plotting, but it is unsuitable for round-trips between discretize and discretize_on_midpoints  (constant controls on tlist may result in a zig-zag on the intervals of tlist).\n\nIf control is a vector, it will be returned un-modified if it is of the same length as tlist. Otherwise, control must have one less value than tlist, and is assumed to be defined on the midpoins of tlist. In that case, discretize acts as the inverse of discretize_on_midpoints. See discretize_on_midpoints for how control values on tlist and control values on the intervals of tlist are related.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#QuantumControlBase.discretize_on_midpoints-Union{Tuple{T}, Tuple{T, Any}} where T<:Function","page":"Home","title":"QuantumControlBase.discretize_on_midpoints","text":"Evaluate control at the midpoints of tlist.\n\nvalues = discretize_on_midpoints(control, tlist)\n\ndiscretizes the given control to a Vector of values on the midpoints of tlist. Hence, the resulting values will contain one less value than tlist.\n\nIf control is a vector of values defined on tlist (i.e., of the same length as tlist), it will be converted to a vector of values on the intervals of tlist. The value for the first and last \"midpoint\" will remain the original values at the beginning and end of tlist, in order to ensure exact bounary conditions. For all other midpoints, the value for that midpoint will be calculated by \"un-averaging\".\n\nFor example, for a control and tlist of length 5, consider the following diagram:\n\ntlist index:       1   2   3   4   5\ntlist:             ⋅   ⋅   ⋅   ⋅   ⋅   input values cᵢ (i ∈ 1..5)\n                   |̂/ ̄ ̄ ̂\\ / ̂\\ / ̂ ̄ ̄\\|̂\nmidpoints:         x     x   x     x   output values pᵢ (i ∈ 1..4)\nmidpoints index:   1     2   3     4\n\nWe will have p₁=c₁ for the first value, p₄=c₅ for the last value. For all other points, the control values cᵢ = fracp_i-1 + p_i2 are the average of the values on the midpoints. This implies the \"un-averaging\" for the midpoint values pᵢ = 2 c_i - p_i-1.\n\nnote: Note\nAn arbitrary input control array may not be compatible with the above averaging formula. In this case, the conversion will be \"lossy\" (discretize will not recover the original control array; the difference should be considered a \"discretization error\"). However, any further round-trip conversions between points and intervals are bijective and preserve the boundary conditions. In this case, the discretize_on_midpoints and discretize methods are each other's inverse. This also implies that for an optimal control procedure, it is safe to modify midpoint values. Modifying the the values on the time grid directly on the other hand may accumulate discretization errors.\n\nIf control is a vector of one less length than tlist, it will be returned unchanged, under the assumption that the input is already properly discretized.\n\nIf control is a function, the function will be directly evaluated at the midpoints marked as x in the above diagram..\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#QuantumControlBase.get_control_parameters-Tuple","page":"Home","title":"QuantumControlBase.get_control_parameters","text":"Collect all control parameters from the given objectives.\n\nget_control_parameters(objectives...; kwargs...)\n\nreturns a vector of control parameters extracted from the controls in objectives.

If the two-qubit level are a logical subspace embedded in a larger physical Hilbert space, loss of population from the logical subspace may lead to a non-unitary U. In this case, the unitarity measure can be added to the functional by giving a unitary_weight ∈ [0, 1) that specifies the relative proportion of the D term and the unitarity term.\n\nBy specifying absolute_square=true, the functional is modified as D  D², optimizing specifically for the boundary of the perfect entanglers polyhedron. This accounts for the fact that D can take negative values inside the polyhedron, as well as the W1 region of the Weyl chamber (the one adjacent to SWAP). This may be especially useful in a system with population loss (unitarity_weight > 0), as it avoids situations where the optimization goes deeper into the perfect entanglers while increasing population loss.\n\nwarning: Warning\nThe functional does not check which region of the Weyl chamber the quantum gate is in. When using this for an optimization where the guess leads to a point in the W1 region of the Weyl chamber (close to SWAP), the sign of the functional must be flipped, or else it will optimize for SWAP.
